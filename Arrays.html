		//It takes one parameter: a function that is called on every element of the array. And it returns a new array, so no side effects here.
		
	const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]

	const numbersPlusOne = numbers.map(n => n + 1) // Adds one to every element
	console.log(numbersPlusOne) // [2, 3, 4, 5]

	const numbersTimesTwo = numbers.map(n => n * 2) // Adds one to every element
	console.log(numbersTimesTwo) // [2, 3, 4, 5]

	const numbersPlusTen = numbers.map(n => n + 10)
	console.log(numbersPlusTen)

	const numbersMinusFive = numbers.map(n => n - 5)
	console.log(numbersMinusFive)


	//You can also create a new array that keeps only one particular property of an object:

	const allActivities = [
  { title: 'My activity', coordinates: [50.123, 3.291] },
  { title: 'Another activity', coordinates: [1.238, 4.292] },
  // etc.
	]

	const allCoordinates = allActivities.map(activity => activity.coordinates)
	console.log(allCoordinates) // [[50.123, 3.291], [1.238, 4.292]]

		//So, remember, whenever you need to transform an array, think of using map.


	// street = [
	// 	0: { grocer: True},
	// 	1: {'school': True, 'musuem': True} [3, 1, 0]
	// 	2: {}, [|4-2|=2, |0-2|=2, |1-2|=1]
	// 	3: {}, [1,3,2]
	// 	4: {'bookstore': True},
	// 	5: {'museum': True},
	// 	6: {'grocer': True}
	// 	]

	// 	requirements = {
	// 		'bookstore': True,
	// 		'grocer': True,
	// 		'school': True,
	// 	}


	// const streetLocation = street.map(street => street.requirements)
	// console.log(streetLocation) 




	// Just like map does, it takes a function as its only parameter that is called on every element of the array. This function needs to return a boolean:

	// true if you want to keep the element in the array
	// false if you don‚Äôt want to keep it.
	// Then you‚Äôll have a shiny new array with the elements you wanted tok eep.

	// For example, you can keep just the odd numbers in an array:

	const numbersTwo = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
	const oddNumbers = numbersTwo.filter(n => n % 2 !== 0)
	console.log(oddNumbers) // [1, 3, 5]

	const numbersThree = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
	const evenNumbers = numbersThree.filter(n => n % 2 ===0)
	console.log(evenNumbers)

	
	 // you can also use it to remove a particular item in an array:

	const participants = [
	  { id: 'a3f47', username: 'john' },
	  { id: 'fek28', username: 'mary' },
	  { id: 'n3j44', username: 'sam' },
	]

	function removeParticipant(participants, id) {
	  return participants.filter(participant => participant.id !== id)
	}

	console.log(removeParticipant(participants, 'a3f47')) //  [{ id: 'fek28', username: 'mary' }, { id: 'n3j44', username: 'sam' }];


	// reduce
	// Most difficult method to understand in my opinion. But once you master it, it‚Äôs crazy how many things you can do with it.

	// Basically, reduce is about taking an array of values and combine them into one value. It takes two parameters, a callback function which is our reducer and an optional initial value (which is the first item of the array by default). The reducer itself takes four parameters:

	// The accumulator: it accumulates the returned values in your reducer.
	// The current value of the array
	// The current index
	// The array reduce was called upon
	// Most of the time, you‚Äôll just use the first two parameters: the accumulator and the current value.

	// Let‚Äôs not be too theoretical. Here is the most common example of reduce:

	const numbersReduce = [37, 12, 28, 4, 9]
	const total = numbersReduce.reduce((total, n) => total + n)
	console.log(total) // 90

	//  On the first iteration, the accumulator, which is total, takes an initial value of 37. The returned value is 37 + n and n is equal to 12, thus 49. On the second iteration, the the accumulator is equal to 49, the returned value is 49 + 28 = 77. And so on and so forth.

	// reduce is so powerful that you can actually use it to build a lot of array methods like map or filter:

	const map = (arr, fn) => {
	  return arr.reduce((mappedArr, element) => {
	    return [...mappedArr, fn(element)]
	  }, [])
	}

	console.log(map([1, 2, 3, 4], n => n + 1)) // [2, 3, 4, 5]

	const filter = (arr, fn) => {
	  return arr.reduce((filteredArr, element) => {
	    return fn(element) ? [...filteredArr] : [...filteredArr, element]
	  }, [])
	}

	console.log(filter([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], n => n % 2 === 0)) // [1, 3, 5]

	// Basically, we gave reduce an initial value of []: our accumulator. For map, we ran a function whose result is added at then end of the accumulator thanks to the spread operator (we‚Äôll see it just after, don‚Äôt worry.). For filter, it‚Äôs nearly the same except that we ran the filter function on the element. If it returns true, we return the previous array, otherwise we add the element to the end of the array.

	// Let‚Äôs see a more advanced example: deeply flatten an array, that is to say transforming something like [1, 2, 3, [4, [[[5, [6, 7]]]], 8]] into [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].




	function flatDeep(arr) {
	  return arr.reduce((flattenArray, element) => {
	    return Array.isArray(element)
	      ? [...flattenArray, ...flatDeep(element)]
	      : [...flattenArray, element]
	  }, [])
	}

	console.log(flatDeep([1, 2, 3, [4, [[[5, [6, 7]]]], 8]])) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

	// Spread operator (ES2015)
	// I agree, this is not a method. However, using the spread operator can help you achieve many things when working with arrays. In fact, you can use it to expand the values of an array in another array. From that point, you can make a copy of an array or concatenate multiple arrays.


	const numbersNumbers = [1, 2, 3]
	const numbersCopy = [...numbersNumbers]
	console.log(numbersCopy) // [1, 2, 3]

	const otherNumbers = [4, 5, 6]
	const numbersConcatenated = [...numbersNumbers, ...otherNumbers]
	console.log(numbersConcatenated) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

	// Caution: the spread operator does a shallow copy of the original array. But what does shallow mean? ü§î

	// Well, a shallow copy will duplicate the original elements as little as possible. So when you have an array containing numbers, strings or booleans (primitive types), there‚Äôs no problem, values are really duplicated. However, this is not the same for objects or arrays. Only the reference to the original value will be copied! Therefore, if you make a shallow copy of an array containing an object and that you modify the object in the copied array, it will also modify the object in the original array since they have the same reference.

	const arr = ['foo', 42, { name: 'Thomas' }]
	let copy = [...arr]

	copy[0] = 'bar'

	console.log(arr) // No mutations: ["foo", 42, { name: "Thomas" }]
	console.log(copy) // ["bar", 42, { name: "Thomas" }]

	copy[2].name = 'Hello'

	console.log(arr) // /!\ MUTATION ["foo", 42, { name: "Hello" }]
	console.log(copy) // ["bar", 42, { name: "Hello" }]

	// So, if you want to make a ‚Äúreal‚Äù copy of an array that contains object or arrays, you can use a lodash function like cloneDeep. But don‚Äôt feel like you have to do such a thing. The goal here is to be aware of how things work under the hood.

	// Good to know
	// You‚Äôfll find below other methods that are good to know and that can help you with some problems such as searching an element in an array, taking a portion of an array and more.

	// includes (ES2015)
	// Have you ever used indexOf to know if something is in an array or not? Awful way to do it right? Luckily for us, includes does that for us. Give a parameter to includes and it will search in the array if the element exists.

	const sports = ['football', 'archery', 'judo']
	const hasFootball = sports.includes('football')
	console.log(hasFootball) // true
