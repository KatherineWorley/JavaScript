<h2>Monomial = (of an algebraic expression) consisting of one term.</h2>
<h2>Binomial = In algebra, a binomial is a polynomial that is the sum of two terms, each of which is a monomial. An algebraic expression of the sum or the difference of two terms.</h2>
<h2>Polynomial = In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents of variables</h2>
<h2>Coefficient = In mathematics, a coefficient is a multiplicative factor in some term of a polynomial, a series, or any expression; it is usually a number, but may be any expression. In the latter case, the variables appearing in the coefficients are often called parameters, and must be clearly distinguished from the other variables.</h2>
<h2>Expression = An algebraic expression is a mathematical phrase that can contain ordinary numbers, variables (like x or y) and operators (like add,subtract,multiply, and divide). Here are some algebraic expressions: a + 1. a - b. 3x.</h2>
<h2>Permutation = the action of changing the arrangement, especially the linear order, of a set of items.</h2>
<h2>Factoral = the product of an integer and all the integers below it; e.g. factorial four ( 4! ) is equal to 24.</h2>
<h2>The three input/output (I/O) connections are called standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr).</h2>
